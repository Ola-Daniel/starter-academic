Hi, My name is Daniel Ola-olorun. I am a Cloud Engineer and Security Professional currently living in Nigeria. I love to explore the intersection of Cloud technology, Cyber-security, Privacy and the society.

Occasionally, I write on how the evolution of technology affects our daily lives. When I'm not reading about the latest cyberattack or writing an article, I spend most of my time editing vidoes, writing software or reading a good book. I also enjoy solving machines on hackthebox.eu and tryhackme.com.
